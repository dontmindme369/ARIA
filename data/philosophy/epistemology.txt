Epistemology
            
Epistemology is the philosophical study of knowledge, belief, and justification. It examines what we can know and how we know it.

Central questions:
- What is knowledge? (justified true belief?)
- What are sources of knowledge? (perception, reason, testimony)
- What is justification? (evidence, coherence, reliability)
- Can we have certain knowledge? (skepticism vs. foundationalism)

Different traditions offer competing answers: empiricism emphasizes experience, rationalism emphasizes reason, and pragmatism emphasizes practical consequences.
