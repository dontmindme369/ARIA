Ethics and Moral Philosophy
            
Ethics studies morality, examining what is right, wrong, good, and bad. Different ethical frameworks provide competing approaches.

Major ethical theories:
- Consequentialism: Actions judged by outcomes (utilitarianism)
- Deontology: Actions judged by adherence to rules/duties (Kant)
- Virtue ethics: Focus on character and virtues (Aristotle)
- Care ethics: Emphasizes relationships and caring

Applied ethics addresses real-world issues: bioethics, environmental ethics, business ethics, and AI ethics all draw on these foundational theories.
