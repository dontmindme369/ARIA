Philosophy of Consciousness
            
Consciousness remains one of philosophy's deepest mysteries. Key questions include the nature of subjective experience, qualia, and the hard problem.

Philosophical approaches:
- Dualism: Mind and body are separate substances (Descartes)
- Physicalism: Consciousness emerges from physical processes
- Panpsychism: Consciousness is fundamental to all matter
- Functionalism: Mental states defined by functional roles

The "hard problem" asks why physical processes give rise to subjective experience. This question sits at the intersection of philosophy, neuroscience, and cognitive science.
