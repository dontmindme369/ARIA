Deep Learning
            
Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple hidden layers to learn hierarchical feature representations. This approach has revolutionized computer vision, natural language processing, and speech recognition.

Key innovations:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequences
- Transformers for attention-based processing
- Transfer learning and pre-trained models

Modern deep learning requires substantial computational resources and large datasets but achieves state-of-the-art performance on many tasks.
