Neural Networks
            
Neural networks are computational models inspired by biological neurons. They consist of interconnected layers of artificial neurons that process information through weighted connections.

Architecture:
- Input layer: Receives raw data
- Hidden layers: Transform data through non-linear activations
- Output layer: Produces predictions

Training uses backpropagation and gradient descent to optimize weights. Deep learning extends this to many-layered architectures capable of learning hierarchical representations.
