Supervised Learning
            
Supervised learning is a machine learning paradigm where models learn from labeled training data. The algorithm receives input-output pairs and learns to map inputs to correct outputs.

Key concepts:
- Training data consists of features (X) and labels (y)
- Model learns a function f: X → y
- Performance measured using loss functions
- Common algorithms: Linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks

Applications include classification, regression, and prediction tasks. The model's success depends on data quality, feature engineering, and proper validation.
