Theory of Relativity
            
Einstein's theory of relativity revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. It consists of special and general relativity.

Special Relativity:
- Time and space are relative to the observer
- Speed of light is constant in all reference frames
- Mass-energy equivalence: E = mc²

General Relativity:
- Gravity is curvature of spacetime
- Massive objects bend spacetime
- Predicts black holes, gravitational waves

These theories have been confirmed through numerous experiments and observations.
