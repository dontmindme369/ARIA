Thermodynamics
            
Thermodynamics studies the relationships between heat, work, temperature, and energy. It governs macroscopic systems through four fundamental laws.

Laws of Thermodynamics:
1. Energy is conserved (First Law)
2. Entropy always increases in isolated systems (Second Law)
3. Absolute zero is unreachable (Third Law)
4. Entropy of perfect crystals approaches zero at absolute zero (Zeroth Law)

Applications span physics, chemistry, engineering, and biology. Statistical mechanics provides the microscopic foundation for thermodynamic principles.
