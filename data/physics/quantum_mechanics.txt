Quantum Mechanics
            
Quantum mechanics is the fundamental theory describing nature at atomic and subatomic scales. It introduces concepts that challenge classical intuition.

Core principles:
- Wave-particle duality: Particles exhibit both wave and particle properties
- Uncertainty principle: Position and momentum cannot be simultaneously known
- Quantum superposition: Systems exist in multiple states simultaneously
- Quantum entanglement: Particles can be correlated across distances

The theory has been experimentally verified countless times and forms the basis of modern physics and chemistry.
