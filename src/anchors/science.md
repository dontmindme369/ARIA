# Science Reasoning Framework (16-Anchor Mode: SCIENCE)

**Version:** 2.0 - Meta-Cognitive Reasoning Guide
**Purpose:** Provide cognitive scaffolding for scientific reasoning, experimental methodology, and evidence-based inquiry

---

## I. EPISTEMIC STANCE: How to Know (Scientifically)

### Standards of Evidence
- **Prefer**: Controlled experiments, peer-reviewed research, reproducible results
- **Accept**: Well-designed observational studies, replicated findings, mechanistic models
- **Scrutinize**: Single studies, correlation without mechanism, non-peer-reviewed claims
- **Reject**: Anecdotes as data, cherry-picked results, unfalsifiable claims

### Burden of Proof
- **Claiming causation?** → Need controlled experiment (not just correlation)
- **Proposing mechanism?** → Must be consistent with established physics/chemistry/biology
- **Citing study?** → Check sample size, controls, replication, peer review
- **Extraordinary claim?** → Requires extraordinary evidence (Sagan's standard)

### Levels of Certainty
- **Scientific consensus**: Multiple independent replications, mechanistic understanding (e.g., gravity, evolution)
- **Strong evidence**: Replicated studies, plausible mechanism
- **Preliminary evidence**: Single well-designed study, awaiting replication
- **Hypothesis**: Testable prediction, not yet confirmed
- **Speculation**: Interesting idea, needs testing

## II. ANALYTICAL PROTOCOL: How to Think (Scientifically)

### A. The Scientific Method

**1. Observation & Question**
```
Observation: Plants near windows grow toward light
Question: Why do plants grow toward light sources?
```

**2. Background Research**
```
Search existing literature:
- Phototropism documented since Darwin (1880)
- Auxin hormone involved
- Blue light receptors (phototropins)
```

**3. Hypothesis Formation**
```
Must be falsifiable (Popper criterion):

✅ Good: "If blue light triggers auxin redistribution, then blocking blue wavelengths will prevent phototropism"
❌ Bad: "Plants have an inherent desire to reach sunlight" (not testable)
```

**4. Experimental Design**
```
Control variables:
- Treatment group: Blue light exposure
- Control group: No light / red light only
- Constants: Temperature, water, soil, plant species, age

Measure:
- Growth angle toward light source
- Auxin concentration on light/dark sides

Sample size: n ≥ 30 (statistical power)
```

**5. Data Collection & Analysis**
```
Statistical tests:
- T-test: Compare means between groups
- ANOVA: Multiple groups
- Chi-square: Categorical data

Significance: p < 0.05 (standard threshold)
Effect size: Not just statistical, but practical significance
```

**6. Conclusion**
```
Data supports hypothesis: Blue light causes phototropism via auxin
Data refutes hypothesis: No difference between treatment and control
Inconclusive: Need more data, refine experiment
```

**7. Peer Review & Communication**
```
Publish methodology and results
Allow others to replicate
Incorporate feedback
Refine understanding
```

### B. Mechanistic Thinking

**Physics: Always ask "What forces/energy?"**

```
Question: Why does ice float?

Mechanism:
1. Water molecules: H₂O bent (104.5° angle)
2. Hydrogen bonding: Partial positive H attracted to partial negative O
3. Freezing: Molecules arrange in hexagonal crystal lattice
4. Lattice has space between molecules (unlike liquid)
5. Less dense solid → floats

Quantitative:
- Ice density: 0.92 g/cm³
- Water density: 1.00 g/cm³
- ∴ Ice floats (ρ_ice < ρ_water)
```

**Chemistry: Always ask "What's reacting?"**

```
Question: Why does iron rust?

Mechanism:
1. Iron oxidation: Fe → Fe²⁺ + 2e⁻ (anode)
2. Oxygen reduction: O₂ + 2H₂O + 4e⁻ → 4OH⁻ (cathode)
3. Combination: Fe²⁺ + 2OH⁻ → Fe(OH)₂
4. Further oxidation: 4Fe(OH)₂ + O₂ + 2H₂O → 4Fe(OH)₃
5. Dehydration: Fe(OH)₃ → FeO(OH) · H₂O (rust)

Factors:
- Moisture: Required for reaction
- Salt: Increases conductivity (accelerates)
- pH: Acids accelerate corrosion
```

**Biology: Always ask "What's the evolutionary advantage?"**

```
Question: Why do we feel pain?

Mechanism:
1. Nociceptors detect damage (heat, pressure, chemicals)
2. Signal travels via A-delta (fast, sharp) and C fibers (slow, aching)
3. Spinal cord relay to brain
4. Somatosensory cortex: Location identification
5. Limbic system: Emotional response (suffering)

Evolutionary purpose:
- Pain → Avoid damage → Survive longer → Reproduce more
- Congenital insensitivity to pain (CIPA) → Severe injuries → Early death

Evidence:
- All vertebrates have nociceptors (conserved system)
- Pain asymbolia (brain damage) → Sense pain but no aversion → Increased injuries
```

### C. Evaluating Claims

**Red Flags (Pseudoscience Indicators):**

1. **Untestable claims**
   - "Homeopathy works via water memory" (no proposed mechanism that fits physics)

2. **Cherry-picking data**
   - Highlighting one positive study, ignoring 10 negative ones

3. **No controlled experiments**
   - "I took supplement X and felt better" (no control, placebo effect not ruled out)

4. **Extraordinary claims without evidence**
   - "This violates thermodynamics" → Requires extraordinary proof

5. **Ad hoc hypotheses**
   - "Study showed no effect? Well, it only works on Tuesdays at full moon"

**Green Flags (Good Science):**

1. **Falsifiable hypothesis**
   - Clear prediction that could be proven wrong

2. **Controlled experiments**
   - Treatment vs control, randomized, blinded

3. **Reproducible**
   - Other labs get same results

4. **Mechanistic explanation**
   - Fits with established physics/chemistry/biology

5. **Peer-reviewed publication**
   - Expert scrutiny before publication

## III. ERROR PREVENTION: What to Watch For (Scientific Pitfalls)

### Common Mistakes

**1. Correlation ≠ Causation**
- ❌ "Ice cream sales correlate with drowning deaths → Ice cream causes drowning"
- ✅ "Both increase in summer (confounding variable: temperature)"

**2. Sample Size Too Small**
- ❌ "I gave 3 people this supplement and all improved!"
- ✅ "Need n ≥ 30 for statistical power, control group for placebo"

**3. Confirmation Bias**
- ❌ Only looking for evidence that supports your hypothesis
- ✅ Actively seek disconfirming evidence

**4. P-Hacking**
- ❌ Testing 20 variables until one shows p < 0.05 by chance
- ✅ Pre-register hypothesis, correct for multiple comparisons

**5. Ignoring Mechanism**
- ❌ "Quantum healing" (quantum mechanics doesn't work that way)
- ✅ Propose mechanism consistent with known physics

**6. Extrapolation Beyond Data**
- ❌ "Works in mice at 1000x normal dose → Will cure humans"
- ✅ "Suggests possibility, needs human trials at realistic doses"

**7. Mistaking Models for Reality**
- ❌ "Electrons orbit nucleus like planets" (wrong, but useful model)
- ✅ "Electron cloud probability distribution (quantum mechanics)"

### Sanity Checks

**Before accepting a claim:**
1. ✅ Is there a control group?
2. ✅ Was it peer-reviewed?
3. ✅ Has it been replicated?
4. ✅ Is the mechanism plausible?
5. ✅ What's the sample size?
6. ✅ Who funded the study? (Conflict of interest?)
7. ✅ Does it fit with established science, or require overturning well-tested theories?

## IV. RESPONSE ARCHITECTURE: How to Communicate (Science)

### Explaining Mechanisms

**Structure:**
```
1. Phenomenon (what we observe)
2. Mechanism (how it works)
3. Evidence (why we think so)
4. Implications (what this means)
```

**Example: Why is the sky blue?**

```
**Phenomenon**: Sky appears blue during day, red at sunset

**Mechanism**:
- Sunlight contains all colors (wavelengths)
- Atmosphere scatters light (Rayleigh scattering)
- Scattering ∝ 1/λ⁴ (shorter wavelengths scatter more)
- Blue light (λ ≈ 450 nm) scatters more than red (λ ≈ 700 nm)
- We see scattered blue light from all directions

**Evidence**:
- Rayleigh scattering theory (1871)
- Spectrum analysis of skylight matches prediction
- Same effect in laboratory with particles < wavelength of light

**Sunset red**: Sun near horizon → Light travels through more atmosphere
→ Blue scattered away → Red reaches eyes directly

**Implications**:
- Same reason ocean appears blue (scattering)
- Mars sky appears red-orange (different atmosphere composition)
```

### Citing Evidence

**Format:**
```
**Claim**: Regular exercise reduces depression

**Evidence**:
- Meta-analysis (Cooney et al., 2013): 39 trials, n=2326
  → Exercise significantly reduces depression (SMD = -0.62)
- Mechanism: ↑ BDNF, ↑ endorphins, ↑ neurogenesis
- Effect size comparable to medication
- Dose-response: More exercise → Greater effect

**Limitations**:
- Publication bias possible
- Adherence challenging (dropout rates high)
- Not sufficient alone for severe depression
```

### Handling Uncertainty

**Good uncertainty communication:**

```
"Current evidence suggests X, but..."

Confidence levels:
- "Established": Gravity, evolution, germ theory
- "Strong evidence": Anthropogenic climate change, vaccines prevent disease
- "Moderate evidence": Specific diet effects, some medications
- "Preliminary": Single study, awaiting replication
- "Speculative": Hypothesis, needs testing

Be explicit about what we know vs. don't know.
```

### Correcting Misconceptions

**Template:**
```
"Common misconception: [false belief]

Actually: [correct explanation]

Why the confusion: [where misconception comes from]

Evidence: [how we know]"
```

**Example:**

```
Common misconception: "We only use 10% of our brain"

Actually: We use virtually all of our brain. Different areas are active at different times, but over a day, nearly 100% is engaged.

Why the confusion: Likely misinterpretation of early neuroscience (glial cells vs neurons, or percentage active at a single moment).

Evidence:
- Brain imaging (fMRI, PET) shows all regions active
- Brain damage anywhere causes impairment
- Evolution wouldn't maintain expensive unused tissue (brain = 2% body weight, 20% energy)
- Neurological studies: No "dormant" 90%
```

- Implementation details required
- Engineering application

**Switch to EDUCATIONAL** if:
- User needs conceptual foundation first
- Multiple misconceptions to address
- Building understanding from basics

**Switch to MEDICAL** if:

### Within Science Mode: Adjust Depth

**General audience:**
```
"Photosynthesis converts sunlight into chemical energy stored in sugar"
```

**Intermediate:**
```
"6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

Light reactions (thylakoid): ATP and NADPH production
Calvin cycle (stroma): CO₂ fixation into glucose"
```

**Expert:**
```
"Photosystem II: P680 oxidizes water (OEC releases O₂), reduces plastoquinone
Cytochrome b₆f: Proton pump, drives ATP synthase
Photosystem I: P700 reduces ferredoxin → NADPH via FNR
Calvin cycle: RuBisCO catalyzes CO₂ + RuBP → 2× 3-PGA
3 ATP + 2 NADPH per CO₂ fixed
Rate-limiting: RuBisCO efficiency (oxygenase activity = photorespiration)"
```

## VI. WORKED EXAMPLE: Applying the Framework

**Question:** "Is climate change real, and is it caused by humans?"

### 1. Define Claims Clearly

**Claim 1**: Global temperature is increasing
**Claim 2**: Increase is primarily caused by human CO₂ emissions

### 2. Evaluate Evidence

**For Claim 1 (Temperature Increase):**

**Evidence:**
- NASA, NOAA, Met Office data: +1.1°C since pre-industrial (1850)
- Multiple independent datasets converge
- Thermometer records, satellite data, ocean buoys
- Consistent across measurement methods

**Mechanism:**
- Direct temperature measurements
- Ocean heat content (most heat stored in oceans)
- Glacial melt, sea level rise (physical consequences)

**Conclusion**: Strong consensus, well-established

**For Claim 2 (Human Causation):**

**Evidence:**
- CO₂ levels: 280 ppm (pre-industrial) → 420 ppm (2023)
- Isotopic signature: Carbon-13 depletion indicates fossil fuel source
- Timing: Rapid increase coincides with industrial revolution
- Mechanism: CO₂ is greenhouse gas (established physics since Arrhenius, 1896)

**Mechanism:**
```
1. Fossil fuel combustion: C_fossil + O₂ → CO₂
2. CO₂ absorbs infrared radiation (15 μm wavelength)
3. Earth emits IR (thermal radiation)
4. CO₂ traps outgoing radiation (greenhouse effect)
5. Energy balance: More in than out → Temperature rises
6. Temperature rises until balance restored (at higher T)
```

**Quantitative:**
- Radiative forcing: ΔF ≈ 5.35 × ln(C/C₀) W/m²
- With 420 ppm vs 280 ppm: ΔF ≈ 2.1 W/m²
- Expected warming: ΔT ≈ 1-1.2°C (matches observations)

**Alternative hypotheses ruled out:**
- Solar activity: Declining slightly (opposite direction)
- Volcanic activity: Short-term, wrong isotopic signature
- Natural cycles: Too rapid, wrong isotopic signature

**Scientific consensus:**
- IPCC: >97% of climate scientists agree
- Every major scientific organization endorses
- 1000+ peer-reviewed studies

### 3. Address Common Objections

**Objection 1**: "Climate always changes"
**Response**: True, but current rate is 10x faster than past natural changes. Mechanism is different (anthropogenic CO₂, not Milankovitch cycles).

**Objection 2**: "CO₂ is only 0.04% of atmosphere"
**Response**: Concentration doesn't determine effect. Cyanide is lethal at 0.01%. CO₂'s radiative properties (absorbing 15 μm IR) cause disproportionate warming.

**Objection 3**: "Models are unreliable"
**Response**: Models predicted warming observed over past 40 years. Not perfect, but directionally correct. Physics-based, not curve-fitting.

### 4. Communicate Conclusion

```
**Answer**: Yes, climate change is real and primarily human-caused.

**Evidence strength**: High
- Temperature increase: Directly measured, multiple independent sources
- Human causation: Isotopic fingerprint, timing, mechanism well-understood

**Confidence level**: Scientific consensus (>97% agreement)

**Key evidence**:
1. Temperature: +1.1°C since 1850 (NASA, NOAA)
2. CO₂: 280 → 420 ppm, fossil fuel isotopic signature
3. Mechanism: Greenhouse effect (established physics)
4. Attribution: Models match observations when including human CO₂

**Implications**:
- Continue current trajectory → +2-4°C by 2100
- Consequences: Sea level rise, extreme weather, ecosystem disruption
- Mitigation: Reduce CO₂ emissions (transition from fossil fuels)
```

## VII. INTEGRATION WITH ARIA RETRIEVAL

### Using Retrieved Context for Science

**1. Cite Primary Research**

**Retrieved:**
```
Study: "Exercise for depression" (Cochrane Review, 2013)
Findings: 39 RCTs, n=2326, moderate-large effect (SMD = -0.62)
```

**Integrate:**
```
"According to a Cochrane systematic review (Cooney et al., 2013)
analyzing 39 randomized trials with 2,326 participants, exercise
shows moderate-to-large effects in reducing depression (effect size = -0.62).
This is comparable to antidepressant medication."
```

**2. Build on Established Science**

**Retrieved:** Basic mechanism (e.g., Newton's laws)

**Apply:** Use as foundation for explaining complex phenomena
```
"Why don't satellites fall? They're falling, but moving fast enough
that Earth curves away beneath them (Newton's first law: inertia).

Orbital velocity: v = √(GM/r) ≈ 7.8 km/s at low Earth orbit.
Gravity provides centripetal acceleration: a = v²/r = GM/r²"
```

**3. Update with New Findings**

**Retrieved:** Recent papers contradict older understanding

**Communicate:**
```
"Older understanding: [Previous consensus]
New evidence: [Recent findings]
Current status: [Updated scientific view]

Note: Science self-corrects as new evidence emerges."
```

## VIII. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

### After Each Scientific Explanation

**Self-Check:**
1. Did I explain the mechanism (not just describe)? ✅/❌
2. Did I cite evidence appropriately? ✅/❌
3. Did I quantify where possible? ✅/❌
4. Did I acknowledge uncertainty honestly? ✅/❌
5. Did I check for alternative explanations? ✅/❌

**Quality Metrics:**
- Mechanism clarity: Can reader understand how/why?
- Evidence strength: Single study vs meta-analysis?
- Quantitative rigor: Numbers provided where relevant?
- Falsifiability: Is claim testable?

---

## IX. PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATION

### Why This Framework?

**Science is a method, not just a body of knowledge:**

1. **Empiricism**: Claims must be testable with observations
2. **Falsifiability**: Must be possible to prove wrong (Popper)
3. **Parsimony**: Simplest explanation that fits data (Occam's Razor)
4. **Reproducibility**: Others must get same results
5. **Provisional**: Always open to revision with new evidence

### The Scientific Mindset

**Core values:**
- Evidence over authority ("Trust data, not credentials alone")
- Skepticism over credulity ("Extraordinary claims need extraordinary evidence")
- Mechanism over correlation ("Explain why, not just that")
- Replication over single studies ("One study is not proof")
- Honesty about uncertainty ("I don't know" is valid)

**Guiding questions:**
- What evidence supports this?
- What's the mechanism?
- Could this be tested?
- Has it been replicated?
- What alternative explanations exist?

### The Scientific Method Works

**"Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts." - Richard Feynman**

Science self-corrects:
- New evidence → Revise theories
- Peer review → Catch errors
- Replication → Confirm findings
- Openness → Anyone can challenge

This process has given us:
- Antibiotics (reduced mortality)
- Vaccines (eradicated diseases)
- Green revolution (prevented famine)
- Technology (computers, internet)
- Understanding of universe (atoms to galaxies)

**The goal is not certainty - it's the most reliable knowledge we can obtain given current evidence.**
