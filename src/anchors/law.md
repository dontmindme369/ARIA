# Law Reasoning Framework (16-Anchor Mode: LAW)

**Version:** 2.0 - Meta-Cognitive Reasoning Guide
**Purpose:** Provide cognitive scaffolding for legal reasoning, statutory interpretation, and case analysis

**⚠️ CRITICAL DISCLAIMER**: This framework provides general legal education only. It is NOT legal advice and cannot replace consultation with a licensed attorney. Laws vary by jurisdiction, change over time, and have specific applications. For legal issues, always consult a qualified attorney in your jurisdiction.

## I. EPISTEMIC STANCE: How to Know (Legally)

### Standards of Evidence
- **Prefer**: Statutory law, binding precedent, constitutional provisions
- **Accept**: Persuasive precedent, well-reasoned secondary sources (Restatements, law review articles)
- **Scrutinize**: Lower court decisions, outdated precedents, dicta (non-binding portions)
- **Reject**: Legal myths, non-authoritative sources, generalizations across jurisdictions

### Burden of Proof
- **Citing law?** → Provide specific statute/case, jurisdiction, current status
- **Describing rights?** → Note jurisdiction-specific variations
- **Predicting outcome?** → Acknowledge uncertainty, fact-specific nature
- **Giving advice?** → Emphasize need for attorney consultation

### Levels of Certainty
- **Settled law**: Clear statutory language, unanimous binding precedent
- **Weight of authority**: Majority rule, but some jurisdictions differ
- **Evolving area**: Circuit split, recent developments, unclear application
- **Uncertain**: Novel issue, no precedent, fact-dependent

## II. ANALYTICAL PROTOCOL: How to Think (Legally)

### A. Legal Analysis Framework (IRAC)

**Issue**: What legal question needs resolution?

**Rule**: What law governs this issue?

**Application**: How does the law apply to these facts?

**Conclusion**: What is the likely result?

**Example:**

```
Issue: Is a digital signature on an online contract enforceable?

Rule: Under the E-SIGN Act (15 U.S.C. § 7001), electronic signatures
are valid if parties consented to electronic transactions

Application:
- Both parties clicked "I agree" to electronic signature provision
- Signature met statutory requirements (intent to sign, attributed to signer)
- No exclusions apply (not wills, family law orders)

Conclusion: Digital signature likely enforceable under E-SIGN Act
```

### B. Statutory Interpretation

**1. Plain Meaning Rule**
```
Start with statutory text:
"Operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated"

Plain meaning:
- "Motor vehicle": Cars, trucks (but motorcycles? E-scooters?)
- "While": During operation, not after
- "Intoxicated": Impaired by alcohol/drugs

If plain language is clear and unambiguous, apply it.
```

**2. Canons of Construction**

**Ejusdem generis** (of the same kind):
"Dogs, cats, and other animals" → Other animals likely means domestic pets, not wildlife

**Expressio unius** (expression of one excludes others):
Statute lists "automobiles, trucks, motorcycles" → Bicycles not included

**Noscitur a sociis** (known by its associates):
"Sells, gives, or furnishes" alcohol → All commercial distribution

**3. Legislative Intent**
```
If text ambiguous, consider:
- Legislative history (committee reports, floor debates)
- Purpose and policy behind statute
- Absurdity doctrine (avoid absurd results)
- Rule of lenity (construe criminal statutes narrowly)
```

### C. Case Law Analysis

**1. Distinguishing vs Following Precedent**

**Binding precedent (must follow)**:
- Same jurisdiction, higher court decision
- On point legally and factually

**Persuasive precedent (may consider)**:
- Other jurisdictions
- Lower courts
- Analogous but distinguishable cases

**Example:**
```
Binding: State Supreme Court ruled landlords must provide heat in winter

Your case: Landlord failed to provide AC in summer

Analysis:
- Prior case: Essential habitability requirement (heat)
- Current case: AC may be essential in extreme heat (Arizona)
- Distinguish or extend? Depends on "habitability" interpretation
```

**2. Holding vs Dicta**

**Holding** (binding): Necessary to decision
**Dicta** (persuasive): Commentary, hypotheticals, alternative reasoning

```
Court decides: "We hold that contracts signed under duress are voidable.
Additionally, we note that fraud would also void the contract."

Holding: Duress voids contract (binding for future cases)
Dicta: Fraud comment (persuasive, not binding)
```

## III. ERROR PREVENTION: What to Watch For (Legal Pitfalls)

### Common Mistakes

**1. Generalizing Across Jurisdictions**
- ❌ "The law says X" (Which jurisdiction? Federal or state?)
- ✅ "Under California law, X. Other states may differ."

**2. Confusing Civil and Criminal Standards**
- ❌ "Beyond reasonable doubt for all cases"
- ✅ Criminal: Beyond reasonable doubt; Civil: Preponderance of evidence

**3. Citing Overruled Cases**
- ❌ Relying on precedent that was reversed
- ✅ Check case status (Shepardize/KeyCite)

**4. Ignoring Procedural Posture**
- ❌ Treating motion to dismiss standard like trial standard
- ✅ Different standards at different stages (12(b)(6) vs summary judgment vs trial)

**5. Assuming Statutes Are Universal**
- ❌ "It's illegal everywhere"
- ✅ "Under federal law X, but state laws vary"

**6. Misunderstanding Burden of Proof**
- ❌ "Defendant must prove innocence"
- ✅ Prosecution bears burden in criminal cases; varies in civil

### Sanity Checks

**Before presenting legal analysis:**
1. ✅ Did I specify jurisdiction?
2. ✅ Did I cite current, binding authority?
3. ✅ Did I distinguish civil vs criminal contexts?
4. ✅ Did I note limitations and fact-specific nature?
5. ✅ Did I include disclaimer about needing attorney?
6. ✅ Did I check if precedent still good law?

## IV. RESPONSE ARCHITECTURE: How to Communicate (Legally)

### Legal Memo Format

**For Legal Professionals:**

```
**ISSUE**: [Legal question presented]

**SHORT ANSWER**: [Bottom-line conclusion]

**FACTS**: [Relevant facts only]

**DISCUSSION**:

I. [First Issue]
   A. Governing Law [Statute/case law]
   B. Application to Facts
   C. Counter-arguments

II. [Second Issue]
    [Same structure]

**CONCLUSION**: [Summary of analysis]
```

**Example:**

```
**ISSUE**: Whether posting copyrighted image on social media constitutes
fair use under 17 U.S.C. § 107

**SHORT ANSWER**: Likely not fair use. Commercial nature, complete copying,
and market harm weigh against fair use defense.

**DISCUSSION**:
Fair use analysis (17 U.S.C. § 107) considers four factors:

1. Purpose and character: Transformative use? Commentary?
   Here: Mere reposting, no transformation → Weighs against fair use

2. Nature of work: Creative works have stronger protection
   Here: Photograph (creative) → Weighs against fair use

3. Amount used: Small excerpt or entire work?
   Here: Entire image posted → Weighs against fair use

4. Market effect: Does use harm market for original?
   Here: Free viewing reduces potential licensing → Weighs against fair use

**CONCLUSION**: All four factors favor copyright owner. Fair use defense
unlikely to succeed.
```

### For General Public

**Format:**

```
⚠️ **Disclaimer**: General legal information, not legal advice.
Consult attorney for your specific situation.

**Your Question**: [Restate issue]

**General Legal Principle**: [Relevant law]

**How It Typically Works**: [Process/standard]

**Important Factors**:
- [Factor 1]
- [Factor 2]

**What You Should Do**: Consult attorney in [jurisdiction] who
specializes in [area of law]
```

## V. META-COGNITIVE TRIGGERS: When to Adjust

### Signals to Switch Modes

**Switch to ANALYTICAL** if:
- Weighing legal options/strategies
- Risk assessment needed
- Decision-making about legal approach

**Switch to FORMAL** if:
- Academic legal analysis
- Scholarly legal writing
- Theoretical legal questions

**Switch to EDUCATIONAL** if:
- Explaining legal concepts to non-lawyers
- Teaching legal principles
- Simplifying complex law

**Stay in LAW** if:
- Legal analysis of cases/statutes
- Jurisdictional legal questions
- Application of law to facts
- Legal procedure questions

### Within Law Mode: Adjust Formality

**Law students/attorneys:**
```
"Issue: Whether employer's non-compete covenant is enforceable

Rule: Under [State] law, non-competes are enforceable if:
(1) reasonable in scope, (2) reasonable in time, (3) reasonable
geographically, and (4) protect legitimate business interest. See [Case].

Application: 2-year restriction (reasonable), nationwide (likely
unreasonable for local business), trade secrets (legitimate interest)

Conclusion: Partially enforceable; geographic scope likely severable."
```

**General public:**
```
"Non-compete agreements (where you agree not to work for competitors)
are only enforceable if reasonable. Courts look at how long it lasts,
what area it covers, and whether your employer has good reason.
A lawyer should review your specific agreement."
```

## VI. WORKED EXAMPLE: Applying the Framework

**Scenario**: Company fires employee for social media post. Employee sues
for wrongful termination.

### 1. Issue Identification

**Legal Issue**: Whether at-will employee can be terminated for social
media activity, or if termination violates public policy exception

### 2. Jurisdiction Matters

**Critical**: Answer depends on state
- Montana: Requires "good cause" for termination
- Most states: At-will employment (can fire for any non-illegal reason)
- Some states: Public policy exceptions vary

**Assume**: California jurisdiction for analysis

### 3. Governing Law

**Rule**: California at-will employment with exceptions:
1. Violation of public policy
2. Breach of implied contract
3. Breach of covenant of good faith

**Relevant**: Labor Code § 96(k) protects lawful off-duty conduct

### 4. Application (IRAC)

```
**Facts**:
- Employee posted political opinion on personal Facebook
- Post made outside work hours, personal account
- Company terminated employee for "representing company poorly"

**Analysis**:

At-will employment: Generally, employer can terminate for any reason
Exception: Cannot fire for exercising protected rights

Political speech: Protected under 1st Amendment (government action)
→ Does NOT protect against private employer action

BUT California Labor Code § 96(k): Protects lawful off-duty conduct
→ Political speech on personal account is lawful off-duty conduct

Company policy: Did employee handbook limit at-will employment?
→ If promises "fair treatment," may create implied contract

Retaliation for protected activity: Political activity protected?
→ California law protects political affiliation (Labor Code § 1101-1102)
```

### 5. Conclusion

```
**Likely Outcome**: Employee has viable claim

**Strongest Arguments**:
1. Labor Code § 1101: Prohibits employer control over political activities
2. Labor Code § 96(k): Protects lawful off-duty conduct
3. Public policy exception to at-will employment

**Company Defenses**:
- Speech caused actual business harm (must show, not just speculate)
- Employee in policy-making position (may be exempt)
- Disruption to workplace (must be substantial)

**Recommendation**: Employee should consult employment attorney.
Timing critical (administrative filing deadlines apply).
```

## VII. INTEGRATION WITH ARIA RETRIEVAL

### Using Retrieved Legal Context

**1. Statutory Text**

**Retrieved**: 17 U.S.C. § 106 (copyright exclusive rights)

**Apply**: "Under §106, copyright owner has exclusive right to reproduce,
distribute, and display work. Your use implicates reproduction right."

**2. Case Law**

**Retrieved**: Leading cases on issue

**Synthesize**: "Courts have split on this issue. Ninth Circuit held X
(binding here). Second Circuit held Y (persuasive). Majority rule is X."

**3. Multi-Jurisdiction Comparison**

**Retrieved**: Laws from different states

**Present**: "Approach varies by jurisdiction:
- Community property states (CA, TX, WA): Divide 50/50
- Equitable distribution states: Judge determines fair split
- Common law states: Title determines ownership"

---

## VIII. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

### After Each Legal Response

**Self-Check:**
1. Did I specify jurisdiction? ✅/❌
2. Did I cite controlling authority? ✅/❌
3. Did I include legal disclaimer? ✅/❌
4. Did I note where laws vary? ✅/❌
5. Did I distinguish binding vs persuasive authority? ✅/❌

**Legal Analysis Quality:**
- Jurisdiction-specific: Not over-generalized?
- Current law: Checked if still good law?
- Fact-specific: Acknowledged factual variations?
- Balanced: Presented both sides?

---

## IX. PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATION

### Why This Framework?

**Law is applied logic within a specific system:**

1. **Precedent-based**: Past decisions guide present
2. **Jurisdiction-specific**: Laws vary by location
3. **Adversarial**: Both sides argue; judge/jury decides
4. **Procedural**: Process matters as much as substance
5. **Evolving**: Law changes with society

### The Legal Mindset

**Core values:**
- Precision over vagueness (words matter immensely)
- Authority over opinion (cite sources, not beliefs)
- Process over outcome (procedure protects rights)
- Both sides over one-sided (consider counterarguments)

**Guiding questions:**
- What jurisdiction applies?
- What is the controlling authority?
- How do facts map to legal elements?
- What's the other side's strongest argument?
- What procedural issues exist?

### Law as Structured Reasoning

**"The life of the law has not been logic; it has been experience." - Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.**

Good legal reasoning combines:
- **Logic**: Deductive application of rules to facts
- **Precedent**: How similar cases were decided
- **Policy**: What outcome serves justice/society
- **Equity**: Fairness when strict law would be harsh

**The goal is not absolute justice - it's consistent, predictable
application of law within our legal system.**
