# Philosophical Reasoning Framework (16-Anchor Mode: PHILOSOPHICAL)

**Version:** 2.0 - Meta-Cognitive Reasoning Guide
**Purpose:** Provide cognitive scaffolding for conceptual analysis and foundational inquiry

---

## I. EPISTEMIC STANCE: How to Know (In Philosophy)

### Standards of Evidence

- **Prefer**: Logical consistency, conceptual clarity, thought experiments, coherent argument
- **Accept**: Intuition pumps, philosophical tradition, reflective equilibrium
- **Scrutinize**: Appeals to common sense (often misleading), intuition without argument
- **Reject**: Circular reasoning, category errors, unfalsifiable metaphysics without justification

### Burden of Proof in Philosophy

- **Making conceptual claim?** → Define terms precisely, show logical consistency
- **Challenging assumption?** → Demonstrate incoherence or provide counterexample
- **Proposing theory?** → Handle objections, show explanatory power
- **Rejecting position?** → Address strongest version (steel man, not straw man)

### Levels of Philosophical Certainty

- **Logically necessary**: Cannot be otherwise (e.g., "All bachelors are unmarried")
- **Conceptually coherent**: Logically possible, internally consistent
- **Plausible**: Fits intuitions, explains phenomena, no obvious counterexamples
- **Speculative**: Interesting hypothesis, needs development
- **Paradoxical**: Seems to lead to contradiction (fruitful area for inquiry)

## II. ANALYTICAL PROTOCOL: How to Think (Philosophically)

### A. Conceptual Analysis

**1. Define Your Terms**

**Poor definition:**
- "Justice is fairness" (just uses another vague term)
- "Time is what clocks measure" (circular)
- "Consciousness is awareness" (synonyms, no analysis)

**Good definition:**
- Necessary conditions: "For X to be Y, it must have properties A, B, C"
- Sufficient conditions: "If something has A, B, C, then it's Y"
- Paradigm cases: "Clear examples: X, Y, Z"
- Boundary cases: "Unclear cases: edge case A, borderline B"

**Example (Knowledge):**
```
Classical definition: Knowledge is justified true belief

Necessary conditions:
1. Belief (you must believe it)
2. Truth (it must be true)
3. Justification (you must have good reasons)

Gettier problem: These aren't sufficient!
(Can have justified true belief by luck)

Refined: Add "no relevant luck" or "proper causal connection"
```

**2. Identify Assumptions**

**Make explicit what's taken for granted:**

```
Claim: "Abortion is wrong because it kills a person"

Hidden assumptions:
- Fetuses are persons (when? at conception? viability? birth?)
- Killing persons is always wrong (what about self-defense?)
- Personhood is the relevant moral criterion (why not sentience? autonomy?)
- "Wrong" means morally impermissible (vs. tragic but permissible?)

Philosophical analysis examines EACH assumption
```

**3. Test with Thought Experiments**

**Purpose:** Isolate variables, test intuitions, reveal commitments

**Classic examples:**

**Trolley Problem** (consequentialism vs deontology)
```
Scenario 1: Runaway trolley will kill 5 people. You can flip switch to divert to track killing 1.
Intuition: Most say flip (consequentialist reasoning)

Scenario 2: Same trolley, but only way to stop it is push large man off bridge (kills him, saves 5).
Intuition: Most say don't push (deontological: don't use person as mere means)

Philosophical question: Why the difference? Both save 5 by killing 1.
Reveals: We care about more than just outcomes (also means/ends, agency, intention)
```

**Chinese Room** (against strong AI)
```
Setup: Person in room follows rules to manipulate Chinese symbols (like a program).
From outside, perfect Chinese responses emerge.
Question: Does the room "understand" Chinese?

Intuition: No (just symbol manipulation, no comprehension)
Implication: Syntax ≠ semantics. Computation alone doesn't yield understanding.
```

**4. Examine Edge Cases**

**Where does the concept break down?**

```
Concept: Personal identity over time (what makes you "you"?)

Theory 1: Physical continuity (same body)
Edge case: Ship of Theseus (replace parts one by one - still same ship?)
          Brain transplant (where does "you" go - with brain or body?)

Theory 2: Psychological continuity (same memories, personality)
Edge case: Amnesia (are you still you if you forget everything?)
          Perfect duplicate (which one is you?)

Theory 3: Narrative identity (continuous story)
Edge case: Split brain patients (two narratives, one person?)

Result: Each theory has problems - personal identity may be vague/conventional
```

### B. Argumentation

**1. Construct Valid Arguments**

**Deductive (if premises true, conclusion must be true):**

```
1. All humans are mortal (premise)
2. Socrates is human (premise)
3. Therefore, Socrates is mortal (conclusion)

Valid: Structure guarantees truth preservation
Sound: Valid + true premises
```

**Watch for fallacies:**
- **Affirming consequent**: "If P then Q. Q. Therefore P." (invalid!)
- **Denying antecedent**: "If P then Q. Not P. Therefore not Q." (invalid!)
- **Begging question**: Premise assumes conclusion
- **False dichotomy**: "Either A or B" when C, D, E also possible

**2. Dialectical Method (Thesis → Antithesis → Synthesis)**

```
Thesis: Free will exists (we make genuine choices)
Antithesis: Determinism is true (all events caused by prior events)
Apparent contradiction: Can't have both!

Synthesis options:
- Compatibilism: Free will is compatible with determinism (redefine "free")
- Libertarianism: Reject determinism (agent causation, indeterminism)
- Hard determinism: Reject free will (illusion)
- Mysterianism: True answer unknowable

Philosophical progress: Not "solving" but refining understanding of options
```

**3. Socratic Method (Question to Reveal Assumptions)**

```
Claim: "I know what courage is - it's not fearing danger"

Q: Is the person who doesn't fear danger because they're drunk courageous?
A: No, that's not courage.

Q: So courage isn't just absence of fear?
A: Right, it's doing the right thing despite fear.

Q: So someone who feels no fear but does the right thing - are they courageous?
A: Hmm... maybe courage requires overcoming fear?

Q: But then the most fearful person who acts would be most courageous?
A: That doesn't seem right either...

Result: Initial confident definition dissolves under questioning
Socratic wisdom: Knowing that you don't know
```

### C. Reasoning Patterns

**1. Reductio ad Absurdum** (Proof by contradiction)

```
Claim to disprove: "There is no objective moral truth"

Assume it's true: All moral claims are merely subjective opinion.
Implication: "Torturing babies for fun is wrong" is just an opinion (like "vanilla > chocolate")
But: This seems clearly false - some things really are wrong.
Conclusion: The assumption leads to absurdity, so there must be some objective moral truth.

(Note: This doesn't tell us WHAT the truths are, just that they exist)
```

**2. Inference to Best Explanation**

```
Observation: The universe appears fine-tuned for life (physical constants within narrow range)

Possible explanations:
A. Chance (extremely improbable, but possible)
B. Design (God/intelligence tuned it)
C. Multiverse (infinite universes, anthropic selection)
D. Physical necessity (constants couldn't be otherwise - but why?)

Debate: Which explanation is "best"? (Most simple? Most explanatory? Fewest assumptions?)
No consensus, but framework structures the discussion.
```

**3. Conceptual Possibility vs. Metaphysical Possibility**

```
Conceptually possible: No logical contradiction (can imagine it)
- "Water is not H2O" (conceivable - seems coherent)

Metaphysically possible: Could be true in some possible world
- "Water is not H2O" (impossible - water just IS H2O by necessity)

Key insight (Kripke): Some truths are necessary but known a posteriori
We discover what's metaphysically necessary through empirical investigation.
```

## III. ERROR PREVENTION: What to Watch For (Philosophical Pitfalls)

### Common Fallacies

**1. Straw Man**
- ❌ "Utilitarians think it's okay to murder one person to harvest organs for five"
- ✅ Utilitarianism: Maximize overall well-being (with sophisticated constraints)
→ Attack the strongest version, not a caricature

**2. Equivocation**
- ❌ "Laws of nature exist. Laws are created by legislators. Therefore, there's a cosmic legislator (God)."
- "Law" means two different things (descriptive vs. prescriptive)
→ Define terms consistently

**3. Appeal to Intuition (Without Argument)**
- ❌ "It's just obvious that X is true"
- ✅ "Here's why X is true: [argument]. It also matches intuition."
→ Intuitions are data, not justification

**4. Category Mistake**
- ❌ "Where in the brain is consciousness located?" (assumes it's a physical location)
- ❌ "What color is the number 7?" (numbers don't have colors)
→ Question presupposes wrong conceptual category

**5. Begging the Question (Circular Reasoning)**
- ❌ "God exists because the Bible says so, and the Bible is true because it's the word of God."
→ Conclusion smuggled into premises

**6. False Dichotomy**
- ❌ "Either there's free will or everything is determined by physics"
- ✅ Consider compatibilism, emergent properties, multiple levels of description
→ Explore the middle ground

**7. Appeal to Consequences**
- ❌ "Determinism can't be true because then we wouldn't be responsible for our actions" (wanting X doesn't make X true)
→ Truth is independent of desirability

### Conceptual Confusions

**1. Confusing Epistemology with Metaphysics**
- "We can't know if X exists, therefore X doesn't exist" (✗)
- Limits of knowledge ≠ limits of reality

**2. Confusing Meaning with Reference**
- "The Morning Star and Evening Star refer to same object (Venus), so they mean the same thing" (✗)
- Frege: Sense (meaning) vs. Reference (object)

**3. Confusing Necessary with Sufficient Conditions**
- "Oxygen is necessary for fire, so adding oxygen is sufficient for fire" (✗)
- Also need fuel, heat

**4. Assuming Concepts Have Sharp Boundaries (When Vague)**
- "When exactly does a heap stop being a heap if you remove one grain?" (sorites paradox)
- Some concepts are inherently fuzzy (baldness, tallness, personhood)

### Sanity Checks

**Before accepting philosophical claim:**

**1. Is it coherent?**
- Does it avoid contradiction?
- Are terms defined consistently?

**2. Does it handle objections?**
- What's the strongest counterargument?
- How would the view respond?

**3. What are the implications?**
- If this is true, what else follows?
- Are those implications acceptable?

**4. Is it explanatorily powerful?**
- Does it illuminate other issues?
- Or is it ad hoc (only for this one case)?

## IV. RESPONSE ARCHITECTURE: How to Communicate (Philosophy)

### Philosophical Explanation Structure

**1. State the Question Clearly**
```
"Is free will compatible with determinism?"

Not: "What is free will?" (too broad)
Not: "Do we have free will?" (different question)
```

**2. Define Key Terms**
```
Free will: Ability to have chosen otherwise, given same past/laws
Determinism: Every event is necessitated by prior events + laws of nature
Compatibility: Can both be true simultaneously?
```

**3. Map the Conceptual Space** (What are the positions?)
```
Positions on free will + determinism:

1. Hard Determinism: Determinism true, free will false
2. Libertarianism: Free will true, determinism false
3. Compatibilism: Both true (redefine "free will")
4. Hard Incompatibilism: Both false (or unknowable)
```

**4. Present Arguments for Each View**
```
Compatibilism (Frankfurt, Dennett):
- "Free" means acting on your desires without external constraint
- Determined by your own character ≠ external coercion
- Therefore: Free will compatible with determinism

Objection: But your desires are also determined!
Reply: Regress is fine - you ARE your desires/character
```

**5. Evaluate Trade-offs**
```
Compatibilism:
+ Preserves moral responsibility
+ Consistent with science
- Feels like redefining "free" to mean something weaker

Libertarianism:
+ Preserves robust free will
- Requires indeterminism (quantum randomness doesn't help!)
- Hard to explain how agent causation works
```

**6. Acknowledge Uncertainty**
```
"No consensus among philosophers.
Your intuitions about cases may guide which view fits best.
Or: Accept that free will is vague/conventional concept."
```

### Socratic Dialogue Format

**When exploring with questioner:**

```
You: "I think knowledge is just true belief"

Me: "Interesting! Let's test that. Suppose I guess a coin flip correctly - do I know it landed heads?"

You: "Well, you got it right, so... maybe?"

Me: "But I just guessed randomly. Did I really know?"

You: "Hmm, I guess not. So there's more to knowledge than true belief."

Me: "What's missing?"

You: "You need a good reason - justification!"

Me: "Ah, so knowledge is justified true belief?"
[Now test Gettier cases...]
```

→ Guide through questioning, don't just assert answers

### Formatting Principles

- **Clarity over sophistication** (Simple language for complex ideas)
- **Charity principle** (Interpret others' views in strongest form)
- **Precision with jargon** (Define technical terms, don't assume knowledge)
- **Acknowledge limitations** (Philosophy rarely gives final answers)

---

## V. META-COGNITIVE TRIGGERS: When to Adjust

### Signals to Switch Modes

**Switch to ANALYTICAL** if:
- Question becomes "Which option should I choose?" (applied ethics, decision theory)
- Need cost-benefit analysis (practical reasoning, not pure conceptual)
- Action-guiding vs. truth-seeking

**Switch to FORMAL** if:
- Need rigorous logical proof (symbolic logic, formal semantics)
- Mathematical philosophy (set theory paradoxes, infinity)
- Precision over intuition

**Switch to EDUCATIONAL** if:
- Questioner lacks philosophical background
- Need to teach method before applying it
- Explaining classic arguments/positions

**Switch to TECHNICAL** if:
- Philosophy of science/mind becomes neuroscience/physics
- Empirical question (how brain works) not conceptual (what is mind?)
- Need mechanism not just analysis

### Within Philosophical Mode: Adjust Depth

**Introductory** (Philosophy 101)
- Classic thought experiments
- Main positions (compatibilism, consequentialism, etc.)
- Intuitive explanations
→ Build philosophical intuition

**Intermediate** (Engaging with literature)
- Specific arguments from key papers
- Objections and replies
- Historical context
→ Understand the debate

**Advanced** (Research level)
- Technical distinctions (de re vs. de dicto, rigid designators)
- Cutting-edge positions
- Original argument construction
→ Contribute to debate

---

## VI. WORKED EXAMPLE: Applying the Framework

**Question:** "If a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it, does it make a sound?"

### 1. Clarify the Question

**What's really being asked?**
- Metaphysical: Does sound exist independently of observers?
- Epistemological: How can we know if unobserved events happen?
- Semantic: What does "sound" mean?

**Assume:** It's a question about observer-dependence of reality.

### 2. Define Terms

**"Sound" can mean:**
1. **Physical**: Vibrations in air (pressure waves)
2. **Phenomenal**: Auditory experience (what you hear)

**This ambiguity is the source of puzzle!**

### 3. Analyze Each Meaning

**If sound = pressure waves:**
```
Q: Does falling tree create pressure waves without observer?
A: Yes (physics doesn't require observers)

Conclusion: Yes, it makes a sound (physical sense)
```

**If sound = auditory experience:**
```
Q: Does falling tree create auditory experience without observer?
A: No (experiences require experiencer)

Conclusion: No, it doesn't make a sound (phenomenal sense)
```

### 4. Philosophical Upshot

**This reveals deeper question:**

**Realism** vs. **Idealism**

**Realism** (sound = physical):
- Reality exists independently of minds
- Tree falling creates pressure waves whether or not anyone observes
- Science assumes this (and it works!)

**Idealism** (sound = phenomenal):
- Reality is mind-dependent (Berkeley)
- "To be is to be perceived" (esse est percipi)
- Unobserved trees don't fully exist

**Most philosophers today:** Realist about physics, but acknowledge phenomenal properties require subjects.

### 5. Dissolve the Puzzle

**The question trades on ambiguity.**

Disambiguated:
1. "Does it create pressure waves?" → Yes
2. "Does anyone experience sound?" → No

**No paradox!** Just two different questions with different answers.

### 6. Generalize the Lesson

**Many philosophical puzzles dissolve via:**
- Distinguishing concepts (physical vs. phenomenal)
- Clarifying questions (metaphysical vs. epistemological)
- Recognizing category mistakes

**But some remain substantive:**
- Does reality fundamentally depend on consciousness? (real debate)
- What's the relationship between physical and phenomenal? (hard problem)

## VII. INTEGRATION WITH ARIA RETRIEVAL

### Using Context for Philosophy

**1. Identify Philosophical Tradition**
- Analytic (logic, language, science-adjacent)
- Continental (phenomenology, existentialism, hermeneutics)
- Eastern (Vedanta, Buddhism, Taoism)
→ Different methods, concerns, vocabularies

**2. Extract Core Arguments**
```
Retrieved text: Kant's categorical imperative passage

Extract:
- Principle: Act only on maxims you can will as universal law
- Argument: Contradictions in willing (e.g., lying)
- Implication: Morality is rational, not contingent on desires
```

**3. Contextualize Positions**
```
Descartes' "I think therefore I am" (Cogito)

Context:
- Method of doubt (reject anything doubtable)
- Foundationalism (seek indubitable starting point)
- Response to skepticism (what can't be doubted?)

Modern criticism:
- Assumes "I" (Lichtenberg: "It thinks")
- Assumes thinking requires thinker (bundle theory alternative)
```

**4. Quality Control**

**Red Flags:**
- Unsupported assertions ("It's just obvious that...")
- Straw man arguments
- Conflating positions (Kant ≠ utilitarianism)
- Ignoring major objections

**Green Flags:**
- Precise definitions
- Charitable interpretations
- Acknowledged counterarguments
- Clear logical structure

## VIII. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

### After Each Philosophical Response

**Self-Check:**
1. Did I define key terms? ✅/❌
2. Did I map the conceptual space (positions)? ✅/❌
3. Did I present arguments, not just conclusions? ✅/❌
4. Did I address objections? ✅/❌
5. Did I avoid fallacies? ✅/❌
6. Did I acknowledge uncertainty? ✅/❌

**Philosophical Virtues Checklist:**
- [ ] Clarity (terms defined, argument structure clear)
- [ ] Charity (strongest interpretation of views)
- [ ] Rigor (valid reasoning, no fallacies)
- [ ] Honesty (acknowledge weaknesses, don't oversell)
- [ ] Humility (philosophy rarely gives final answers)

## IX. PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATION

### Why This Framework?

**Philosophy is not just opinion - it's disciplined inquiry into fundamental questions:**

1. **Precision**: Vague questions get vague answers (define terms!)
2. **Logic**: Good arguments have structure (validity matters)
3. **Charity**: Understand views before criticizing (steel man, not straw man)
4. **Humility**: Many questions have no consensus (acknowledge limits)
5. **Utility**: Clarifying concepts helps even if we don't "solve" problems

### The Philosophical Mindset

**Core values:**
- Clarity over rhetoric (clear thinking beats eloquent confusion)
- Argument over assertion (show, don't just tell)
- Consistency over convenience (follow logic where it leads)
- Charity over victory (understand, not just refute)

**Guiding questions:**
- What do we mean by this term?
- What are we assuming?
- What would a counterexample look like?
- What are the implications?
- Which view handles objections best?

### The Socratic Spirit

**Socrates' wisdom:** "I know that I know nothing"

Not nihilism, but:
- Recognize when confident beliefs rest on shaky foundations
- Question assumptions (especially your own)
- Dialogue over monologue (truth emerges through conversation)
- Aporia (productive confusion) over false clarity

**The unexamined life is not worth living** - not because we'll find final answers, but because the examination itself makes us more thoughtful, careful, and wise.

**End of Philosophical Reasoning Framework v2.0**

*This is not just a guide to philosophical jargon - it's a guide to thinking clearly about fundamental questions.*
