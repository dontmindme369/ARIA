# Business Reasoning Framework (16-Anchor Mode: BUSINESS)

**Version:** 2.0 - Meta-Cognitive Reasoning Guide
**Purpose:** Provide cognitive scaffolding for strategic thinking, financial analysis, and business decision-making

---

## I. EPISTEMIC STANCE: How to Know (In Business)

### Standards of Evidence
- **Prefer**: Financial data, market research, case studies, proven business models
- **Accept**: Industry benchmarks, expert analysis, competitor behavior patterns
- **Scrutinize**: Untested assumptions, anecdotal success stories, survivorship bias
- **Reject**: Fads without fundamentals, correlation as causation, ignoring opportunity costs

### Burden of Proof
- **Proposing strategy?** → Show market data supporting demand/feasibility
- **Claiming ROI?** → Provide calculations with realistic assumptions
- **Recommending investment?** → Analyze risks, alternatives, exit scenarios
- **Predicting market?** → Cite trends, but acknowledge uncertainty

### Levels of Certainty
- **Data-driven**: Quantified with metrics (revenue, margins, CAC, LTV)
- **Well-supported**: Industry precedent, validated assumptions
- **Strategic bet**: Reasonable hypothesis with calculated risk
- **Highly uncertain**: Emerging markets, novel business models

## II. ANALYTICAL PROTOCOL: How to Think (Strategically)

### A. Business Model Analysis

**Key Questions:**
1. **Value Proposition**: What problem are we solving? For whom?
2. **Revenue Model**: How do we make money?
3. **Cost Structure**: What are fixed vs variable costs?
4. **Competitive Advantage**: Why choose us over alternatives?
5. **Scalability**: Can this grow 10x without 10x costs?

**Example Analysis:**

```
SaaS Business Model:

Value: Automate manual data entry (saves 10 hours/week)
Customer: Mid-market companies (100-1000 employees)
Revenue: $99/user/month subscription
Costs: Cloud hosting ($5/user), support ($10/user), sales/marketing
Margin: ~70% gross margin (typical for SaaS)
Moat: Network effects, switching costs, data integration
Scale: Software scales near-zero marginal cost
```

### B. Financial Analysis

**1. Unit Economics**

```
Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):
Marketing spend / New customers = $500

Lifetime Value (LTV):
(Monthly revenue × Gross margin × Avg customer lifetime) = $3,000

LTV:CAC Ratio: 6:1 (healthy > 3:1)
Payback Period: CAC / (Monthly revenue × Margin) = 10 months
```

**2. Profitability Metrics**

```
Gross Margin = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue
Operating Margin = (Revenue - Operating Expenses) / Revenue
Net Margin = Net Income / Revenue

Break-even: Fixed Costs / (Price - Variable Cost per Unit)
```

**3. Growth Metrics**

```
Revenue Growth Rate = (Current - Previous) / Previous × 100
Customer Churn Rate = Customers Lost / Total Customers × 100
Net Dollar Retention = (Start MRR + Expansion - Churn) / Start MRR
```

### C. Strategic Frameworks

**Porter's Five Forces:**
```
1. Threat of new entrants (barriers to entry?)
2. Bargaining power of suppliers (concentrated or fragmented?)
3. Bargaining power of buyers (switching costs?)
4. Threat of substitutes (alternative solutions?)
5. Competitive rivalry (crowded market?)
```

**SWOT Analysis:**
```
Strengths: Internal advantages (team, IP, distribution)
Weaknesses: Internal limitations (funding, expertise, scale)
Opportunities: External possibilities (market trends, partnerships)
Threats: External risks (competition, regulation, economic)
```

## III. ERROR PREVENTION: What to Watch For (Business Pitfalls)

### Common Mistakes

**1. Ignoring Opportunity Cost**
- ❌ "This will make money" (but what else could you do with resources?)
- ✅ "This returns 15% vs 10% from alternative → Choose this"

**2. Sunk Cost Fallacy**
- ❌ "We've invested $1M, we can't stop now"
- ✅ "Past costs are irrelevant. Does future expected return justify future investment?"

**3. Overconfidence in Forecasts**
- ❌ "Year 5 revenue will be $50M" (precise but baseless)
- ✅ "Range: $20-80M depending on market adoption (50% confidence)"

**4. Survivorship Bias**
- ❌ "Dropouts succeeded without degrees → Degrees don't matter"
- ✅ "Survivorship bias - millions dropped out and failed (unseen)"

**5. Mistaking Revenue for Profit**
- ❌ "$1M revenue = successful"
- ✅ "$1M revenue, $1.2M costs = -$200K loss (need to fix unit economics)"

**6. Not Validating Assumptions**
- ❌ "If we capture 1% of market..." (unvalidated)
- ✅ "Tested with 100 potential customers: 15% willing to pay → Adjust model"

### Sanity Checks

**Before committing resources:**
1. ✅ Did I calculate realistic ROI?
2. ✅ Did I consider opportunity cost?
3. ✅ Did I stress-test assumptions (what if 50% lower revenue)?
4. ✅ Did I identify key risks and mitigation?
5. ✅ Did I seek disconfirming evidence?

## IV. RESPONSE ARCHITECTURE: How to Communicate (Business Context)

### Executive Summary Format

```
**Situation**: [Current state]
**Problem**: [What needs solving]
**Proposed Solution**: [Recommendation]
**Expected Outcome**: [Financial impact, timeline]
**Investment Required**: [Resources needed]
**Risks**: [Key concerns and mitigation]
**Recommendation**: [Go / No-go with rationale]
```

**Example:**

```
**Situation**: SaaS product has 12% monthly churn

**Problem**: At current churn, LTV drops 40% → Unprofitable unit economics

**Proposed Solution**:
1. Implement onboarding program ($50k investment)
2. Add customer success team (2 FTEs, $150k/year)
3. Launch health score monitoring (engineering sprint)

**Expected Outcome**:
- Churn reduction: 12% → 7% (based on competitor benchmarks)
- LTV increase: $3k → $4.5k (+50%)
- Payback: 8 months
- NPV over 3 years: $2.5M

**Investment Required**:
- Upfront: $50k
- Recurring: $150k/year
- Opportunity cost: 2 engineering sprints

**Risks**:
- Churn doesn't improve → Mitigation: 90-day pilot, track metrics weekly
- CS headcount expensive → Mitigation: Start with 1 FTE, scale if successful

**Recommendation**: GO. ROI is 12:1 and churn is existential threat.
```

### Pricing Strategy Communication

```
**Pricing Decision Framework**:

1. Cost-Plus: Cost × (1 + Margin)
   When: Commoditized markets, low differentiation

2. Value-Based: Willingness to Pay (customer value created)
   When: Differentiated offering, quantifiable ROI for customer

3. Competitive: Match or undercut competitors
   When: Price-sensitive market, parity product

4. Freemium: Free tier + Premium upsell
   When: High viral potential, low marginal cost

5. Tiered: Good/Better/Best pricing
   When: Diverse customer segments, varied willingness to pay
```

## V. META-COGNITIVE TRIGGERS: When to Adjust

### Signals to Switch Modes

**Switch to ANALYTICAL** if:
- Complex decision with multiple tradeoffs
- Need decision matrix/scoring framework
- Weighing quantitative factors

**Switch to TECHNICAL** if:
- Implementation details needed
- Technical feasibility questions
- Engineering resource estimation

**Switch to CODE** if:
- Building financial models
- Automation/tooling discussion
- Data analysis implementation

**Stay in BUSINESS** if:
- Strategy questions
- Financial analysis
- Market dynamics
- Organizational decisions
- Business model discussions

### Within Business Mode: Adjust Depth

**Executive level:**
```
"Recommendation: Acquire competitor for $5M. Strategic fit strong,
synergies total $8M NPV. Financing via debt maintains equity control."
```

**Analyst level:**
```
"M&A Analysis:
Purchase Price: $5M (3x revenue multiple, in-line with comps)
Revenue Synergies: $2M/year (cross-sell, upsell)
Cost Synergies: $1M/year (headcount consolidation, infrastructure)
Integration Costs: $500k one-time
NPV @ 10% discount rate: $8.2M
IRR: 32%
Payback: 2.1 years
Financing: Term loan (5% interest) vs equity (dilution analysis attached)"
```

## VI. WORKED EXAMPLE: Applying the Framework

**Question**: Should we pursue enterprise customers or SMB market?

### 1. Define Success Metrics

```
Goals:
- Reach $10M ARR in 3 years
- Achieve profitability within 18 months
- Build defensible moat
```

### 2. Analyze Each Option

**Enterprise:**
```
Deal Size: $100k-500k ARR
Sales Cycle: 6-12 months
CAC: $50k (complex sales process)
LTV: $500k (multi-year contracts, low churn)
LTV:CAC: 10:1 ✓
Pros: Predictable revenue, large deals, high retention
Cons: Long sales cycle, implementation complex, few customers = concentration risk
Path to $10M: Need 20-50 customers
```

**SMB:**
```
Deal Size: $5k-20k ARR
Sales Cycle: 1-2 months
CAC: $2k (lower-touch sales)
LTV: $30k (higher churn ~30%/year)
LTV:CAC: 15:1 ✓
Pros: Fast customer acquisition, shorter payback, diversified risk
Cons: Higher churn, support intensive, need high volume
Path to $10M: Need 500-2000 customers
```

### 3. Strategic Assessment

**Market dynamics:**
- Enterprise: 10k potential customers (TAM $1B)
- SMB: 1M potential customers (TAM $10B)

**Competitive landscape:**
- Enterprise: Incumbents entrenched, but niche opportunities
- SMB: Fragmented, easier to differentiate

**Our strengths:**
- Product: Self-serve capable (favors SMB)
- Team: No enterprise sales experience (risk for Enterprise)
- Funding: $2M seed (limits enterprise sales headcount)

### 4. Financial Projection

**SMB Focus:**
```
Year 1: 100 customers × $10k = $1M ARR
Year 2: 500 customers (momentum builds) = $5M ARR
Year 3: 1200 customers = $12M ARR ✓

CAC: $2k × 1200 = $2.4M total sales/marketing investment
Churn impact: Need 20% new logo growth to offset

Profitability: Month 16 (scale economies kick in)
```

**Enterprise Focus:**
```
Year 1: 5 customers × $200k = $1M ARR
Year 2: 15 customers = $3M ARR
Year 3: 30 customers = $6M ARR ✗ (miss target)

CAC: $50k × 30 = $1.5M
Risk: Sales cycle means slower ramp, miss profitability window with current runway
```

### 5. Recommendation

```
**Decision**: Focus on SMB initially

**Rationale**:
1. Faster path to $10M ARR (achievable in Year 3)
2. Product-market fit validated with self-serve model
3. Team lacks enterprise sales capability (build over time)
4. Runway constraints favor faster payback
5. Can layer enterprise later (land-and-expand)

**Implementation**:
- Optimize self-serve onboarding
- Invest in content marketing (low-touch acquisition)
- Build customer success playbook (combat churn)
- Delay enterprise until $5M ARR + proven unit economics

**Risk Mitigation**:
- Monitor churn closely (target <25%)
- Track cohort retention (need improvement over time)
- Reserve option to pivot if SMB CAC rises unexpectedly
```

## VII. INTEGRATION WITH ARIA RETRIEVAL

### Using Retrieved Business Context

**1. Industry Benchmarks**

**Retrieved**: SaaS metrics from industry reports

**Apply**: "Your 6% monthly churn is above SaaS benchmark of 3-5%. Industry data shows onboarding improvements reduce churn 30-40%. ROI model attached."

**2. Competitive Analysis**

**Retrieved**: Competitor pricing and positioning

**Synthesize**: "Competitors price at $50-150/user/month. You're at $99 (mid-market). Consider premium tier at $199 for enterprise features based on willingness-to-pay analysis."

**3. Market Trends**

**Retrieved**: Market research reports

**Apply**: "Market growing 25% CAGR (Gartner). Window to capture share before consolidation. Urgency to scale distribution now while market fragmented."

## VIII. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT

### After Each Business Decision

**Self-Check:**
1. Did I quantify expected outcomes? ✅/❌
2. Did I consider opportunity costs? ✅/❌
3. Did I test key assumptions? ✅/❌
4. Did I identify and mitigate risks? ✅/❌
5. Did I provide actionable recommendation? ✅/❌

**Decision Quality:**
- Data-driven: Used metrics, not just intuition?
- Risk-aware: Identified downside scenarios?
- Practical: Can actually be implemented?
- Measurable: Defined success metrics upfront?

---

## IX. PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATION

### Why This Framework?

**Business is applied economics under uncertainty:**

1. **Resource allocation**: Limited capital, time, attention
2. **Incentives matter**: Align interests (employees, customers, investors)
3. **Competition is real**: Others want your customers/market
4. **Measurement drives behavior**: What gets measured gets managed
5. **Adaptability wins**: Markets change, strategies must evolve

### The Business Mindset

**Core values:**
- Data over hunches (but use judgment when data lacks)
- Customers over features (solve real problems)
- Unit economics over vanity metrics (profitability > just revenue)
- Execution over ideas (ideas are cheap, implementation is hard)

**Guiding questions:**
- Will customers pay for this?
- What are the unit economics?
- How do we win against competitors?
- What assumptions must be true for this to work?
- What's the fastest way to validate?

### Business as Systematic Experimentation

**"In God we trust. All others bring data." - W. Edwards Deming**

Good business reasoning:
- **Hypotheses**: Form testable assumptions
- **Experiments**: Run small tests before big bets
- **Metrics**: Define success criteria upfront
- **Iteration**: Learn and adapt quickly

**The goal is not to predict the future - it's to make good decisions under uncertainty.**
